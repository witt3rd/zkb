# Unified Zettelkasten-Ontology System Specification

## 1. Overview

The Unified Zettelkasten-Ontology System (UZOS) is a knowledge management system that combines the principles of Zettelkasten note-taking with ontological relationships. It represents all entities, attributes, and relationships as interconnected notes, using standard Markdown syntax and links to create a flexible, extensible knowledge graph.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Notes

Notes are the fundamental units of information in UZOS. Each note represents a single concept, entity, attribute, or relationship.

Example:

```markdown
# Alice

[[Person]]
[[has-age|30]]
[[has-occupation|Engineer]]
[[works-for|TechCorp]]
```

### 2.2 Links

Links are bidirectional connections between notes. They are represented using standard Markdown link syntax: `[[target|alias]]` or simply `[[target]]` if no alias is needed.

Example:

```markdown
[[has-occupation|Engineer]]
```

### 2.3 Entities

Entities are represented as individual notes. They can be linked to other notes to establish relationships or attributes.

Example:

```markdown
# TechCorp

[[Company]]
```

### 2.4 Attributes

Attributes are represented as links within entity notes. The link target is the attribute value, and the link text is the attribute type.

Example:

```markdown
[[has-age|30]]
```

### 2.5 Relationships

Relationships are represented as links within entity notes. The link target is the related entity, and the link text is the relationship type.

Example:

```markdown
[[works-for|TechCorp]]
```

### 2.6 Types

Types (or classes) are represented as notes that other entities can link to, establishing an "is-a" relationship.

Example:

```markdown
# Person

A Person is an individual human being.

## Known Persons

- [[Alice]]
- [[Bob]]
```

## 3. Note Structure

Each note should follow this general structure:

1. Title (H1 heading)
2. Brief description or definition
3. Type declaration (if applicable)
4. Attributes and relationships
5. Additional sections as needed (e.g., "Known Instances")

Example:

```markdown
# Engineer

An Engineer is a professional who designs, builds, or maintains engines, machines, or structures.

[[Occupation]]

## Known Engineers

- [[Alice]]

## Related Concepts

- [[Engineering]]
- [[Technology]]
```

## 4. Relationship and Attribute Notes

Relationship and attribute types should have their own notes, which can include:

1. Definition of the relationship or attribute
2. List of known instances
3. Related concepts or metadata

Example:

```markdown
# works-for

The works-for relationship represents the employment of a [[Person]] by a [[Company]].

## Known Employments

- [[Alice|TechCorp]]
- [[Bob|TechCorp]]

## Related Concepts

- [[Employment]]
- [[Job]]
```

## 5. Querying and Traversal

The system should support querying and traversing the knowledge graph by following links between notes. This allows for:

1. Finding all entities of a given type
2. Identifying relationships between entities
3. Discovering attributes of an entity
4. Performing graph-based queries (e.g., finding all engineers working for TechCorp)

## 6. Implementation Guidelines

### 6.1 Note Storage

Store notes as individual Markdown files in a directory structure.

### 6.2 Link Parsing

Implement a parser to extract links from Markdown content, identifying both the target and alias (if present).

### 6.3 Database Schema

Design a database schema that stores:

1. Note metadata (filename, title, last modified date)
2. Links between notes (source note, target note, link text)

### 6.4 Query System

Implement a query system that can:

1. Perform full-text search across notes
2. Traverse links to answer complex queries
3. Support basic inference (e.g., if A works-for B and B is-a Company, then A works-for a Company)

### 6.5 User Interface

Provide interfaces for:

1. Creating and editing notes
2. Visualizing the knowledge graph
3. Performing queries and viewing results

## 7. Examples

### 7.1 Entity Representation

Alice.md:

```markdown
# Alice

[[Person]]
[[has-age|30]]
[[has-occupation|Engineer]]
[[works-for|TechCorp]]
```

### 7.2 Type Representation

Person.md:

```markdown
# Person

A Person is an individual human being.

## Known Persons

- [[Alice]]
- [[Bob]]
```

### 7.3 Relationship Representation

works-for.md:

```markdown
# works-for

The works-for relationship represents the employment of a [[Person]] by a [[Company]].

## Known Employments

- [[Alice|TechCorp]]
- [[Bob|TechCorp]]
```

### 7.4 Attribute Representation

has-age.md:

```markdown
# has-age

The has-age relationship represents the age of a [[Person]].

## Known Ages

- [[Alice|30]]
- [[Bob|35]]
```

## 8. Advantages of this Approach

1. Simplicity: Uses standard Markdown syntax, requiring no special parsing.
2. Flexibility: Easily extensible to represent new types of entities, relationships, and attributes.
3. Discoverability: Bidirectional links make it easy to navigate the knowledge graph.
4. Consistency: All concepts (entities, relationships, attributes) are represented uniformly as notes.
5. Human-readability: Notes are easily readable and editable by humans.
6. Machine-processability: Structure allows for automated processing and querying.

This specification provides a foundation for implementing a unified Zettelkasten-Ontology system that combines the flexibility of free-form note-taking with the structured relationships of an ontology.
